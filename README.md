# `plain` - a very barebones theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

This theme keeps things simple. There is no JavaScript. The markup is simple. Styling is plain. And
everything is concatenated into standalone `*.html` files which makes page loads blazingly fast with
only a single request.

This theme was originally forked from
[`comfusion/after-dark`](https://github.com/nerdneilsfield/after-dark), had an intermediate life as
[`ansemjo/hugo-theme-hackcss`](https://github.com/ansemjo/hugo-theme-hackcss) and was then stripped
down to what it is now. `comfusion/after-dark` had been put into public domain originally.

I decided to relicense this derivative under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
